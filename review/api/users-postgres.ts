/**
 * People and sessions in Postgres: tables `users` and `sessions`.
 *
 * This is the answer for a deployment whose instances come and go — Cloud Run above all, where the
 * local disk is ephemeral and per instance, so an access created today vanishes when the platform
 * recycles it, with no error and no log. See `users.ts` for the full reasoning.
 *
 * ## Why `pg` is imported the awkward way
 *
 * `pg` is an **optional** dependency. Whoever runs Doc First on SQLite — which is most people, and
 * the whole "start the image and use it" promise — should not download a Postgres driver, and
 * should not see the install fail if that driver cannot be built. So the import happens at
 * connection time, inside this file, and nowhere else.
 *
 * The module specifier is a constant rather than a literal on purpose: with a literal, the type
 * checker resolves `import('pg')` eagerly and demands the package be installed for everyone,
 * including the people this arrangement exists to spare. The cost is that `pg`'s own types do not
 * reach us, so the shape we use is declared below — six lines, and the compiler still checks every
 * call against them.
