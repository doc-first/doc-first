/**
 * People and sessions in Firestore: collections `users` and `sessions`.
 *
 * This is the answer for Cloud Run, where the local disk is ephemeral and per instance — an access
 * created on one instance disappears when the platform recycles it, with no error and no log. See
 * `users.ts` for why that is the reason this whole seam exists.
 *
 * The document id is the e-mail, already normalised. That is what makes `create` able to use
 * `create()` instead of `set()`: Firestore refuses a document that already exists, so two
 * simultaneous first accesses cannot both win. With a generated id the duplicate would be legal
 * and nobody would notice until two people shared an account.
 *
 * Unlike the event store next door, this collection is NOT insert-only: a password change is an
 * update, and a logout is a delete. People are state, not facts.
 *
 * ⚠️ Proved by the conformance suite ONLY when the emulator is running. `npm test` on its own
 * skips this implementation with a message instead of pretending. To prove it:
 *
 *   firebase emulators:start --only firestore --project doc-first-conformance
 *   FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8433 npm test
 *
 * Without that variable, do not read a green suite as evidence that this file works.

 *
 * ⚠️ `enabled` is read as `!== false`, not as `!!`, and the difference is a whole team locked out.
 * A document written before this field existed has no `enabled` at all, and `undefined` is falsy —
 * so `!!` would refuse everyone who already had an account, with the right password in their hands
 * and nothing in the log to explain it. There is no `ALTER TABLE` in Firestore to fix that after
 * the fact, so the default has to live at the read. Absent means "written before we asked", which
