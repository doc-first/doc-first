/**
 * Who gets in, with user and password, depending on no provider — and WHERE that is kept.
 *
 * It exists so Doc First can be used the way Keycloak is: start the image, log in as admin, get to
 * work. Until here identity came from Google IAP, and that tied the method to one specific cloud —
 * anyone outside GCP had no way to use it.
 *
 * ## Why the storage is pluggable
 *
 * SQLite in a file was the only option, and on Cloud Run a file is **ephemeral and per instance**.
 * An access created at 10:00 lives on the instance that served that request; when the platform
 * recycles it, `users.db` goes with it. The person whose account was created simply stops getting
 * in — **no error, no log, nothing to grep**. Nobody discovers this on the day it is configured;
 * they discover it weeks later, when someone says "it forgot me again".
 *
 * So the same choice Keycloak gives is given here: a file for running on a laptop, a real database
 * for a deployment that survives its own instances. The interface below is the whole contract, and
 * `review/tests/users-conformance.test.js` runs ONE set of tests against every implementation —
 * an implementation that does not pass it is not supported.
 *
 * ## About the passwords
 *
 * - stored with **scrypt** (Node ships it), one salt per person, never in plain text;
 * - comparison in **constant time**, so the response time does not reveal how many characters match;
 * - a hash is derived even for an e-mail that does not exist, or the response time would say who
 *   has an account here;
 * - the admin's initial password is **randomly generated** and shown ONCE in the log of the first
 *   start. "admin/admin" is inviting, but whoever starts it and forgets leaves the door open — and
 *   an internal documentation tool tends to stay up for years with nobody looking;
 * - changing the initial password is **mandatory**: until it changes, the person reaches only the
 *   change screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ All of that lives HERE, in `UserStoreBase`, and not in the implementations. A password hashed
 * one way in SQLite and another way in Postgres is an account that works in one database and not
 * in the other — and the person hits "e-mail or password do not match" with the right password in
 * their hands. The implementations below know about rows. They do not know about scrypt.
 * @module
