 * wins: it is the only one somebody decided on purpose, while the header is usually whatever the
 * laptop shipped with. What was missing was anywhere to KEEP that decision. Without this file
 * `choose()` was called without `person` on every request, so the first candidate was always
 * empty and the browser header always won. The preference existed in the core and could not be
 * expressed by a human being.
 *
 * Nothing here renders HTML. The selector the person clicks is drawn in `review/api/login-page.ts`,
 * next to the template and the escaping it needs; what travels between the two is this route's
 * name and this cookie's name, so neither side has to remember a string the other one owns.
