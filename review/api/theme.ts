/**
 * The project's theme: how a project dresses the engine, in the Keycloak sense.
 *
 * ## The problem this solves
 *
 * `--marca: #0883C5` was written inside review/api/login.html. That is one specific customer's
 * blue, hard-coded into an engine whose whole promise is that it names no company, no client and
 * no product — so every stranger who cloned Doc First was shipping somebody else's brand, and the
 * project that owned the colour had no way to change it except by editing the engine.
 *
 * The fix is the shape Keycloak uses: the ENGINE ships a complete, neutral default, and the
 * deployment overrides the parts it cares about. Here the deployment is `doc-first.json`, the same
 * file that already says where the content lives and who approves it — one file to edit, which is
 * the promise readConfig already makes.
 *
 *     "tema": { "marca": "#2E6E5B", "logo": "tema/logo.svg", "nome": "Template · Handbook" }
 *
 * All three are optional. With no theme at all the engine looks like the engine.
 *
 * ## Why this file distrusts its input
 *
 * `doc-first.json` is a file someone else writes, and its values end up inside CSS and inside
 * HTML. A brand colour of `red; } body { display: none } /*` interpolated into a stylesheet closes
 * the rule it was put in and opens another one — the documentation goes blank and nobody can tell
 * why, and a value that can write arbitrary CSS can also position an invisible element over the
 * sign-in button. So nothing here is interpolated raw: the colour is matched against a grammar,
 * the logo is read from disk by us rather than linked to by them, and the name is escaped by the
 * renderer.
 *
 * ⚠️ Rejection is never silent. Every refusal comes back in `warnings`, because a theme that does
 * not apply and does not complain costs an afternoon of someone reloading the page wondering why
 * their colour is not there.
 *
 * @module

/**
 * A brand colour, as written in `doc-first.json`.
 *
 * ⚠️ HEX ONLY, and three or six digits. That is narrower than CSS allows, on purpose:
 *
 *   - It is a grammar with no punctuation in it. `rgb()` and `hsl()` bring parentheses, commas,
 *     spaces, slashes and percentages, and a validator for them is a small parser — the kind of
 *     code that gets one case wrong and lets a `}` through. `#` plus hex digits has no case to get
 *     wrong.
 *   - Named colours would mean shipping the CSS colour list, or accepting a bare identifier, and a
 *     bare identifier is exactly the shape of an injection payload.
 *   - No alpha (`#rgba` / `#rrggbbaa`). A translucent brand makes a translucent primary button,
 *     which looks like a bug rather than a brand, and it breaks the contrast measurement below:
 *     the readable ink depends on what is BEHIND a see-through colour, which we do not know.
 *
 * Anyone who has a brand has it written as hex already.

 * here: it belongs to the engine's own greys rather than to anybody's identity, so a default
 * install says "no brand has been set" instead of asserting a brand that is not theirs. It carries
 * white text at 8.9:1, so the unthemed screen is also an accessible one.
