/**
 * People and sessions in SQLite, on the built-in `node:sqlite` — **no external dependency**.
 *
 * This is the "start the image and use it" mode: one file on disk, no cloud account, no database
 * to provision. It is the right answer on a laptop, in a container with a real volume, and on any
 * host whose disk survives a restart.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is the WRONG answer on Cloud Run, and silently so: the disk there is ephemeral and lives
 * inside the instance, so an access created today is gone when the platform recycles the instance,
 * with no error anywhere. Use `REVISAO_USERS=postgres://…` or `firestore` there. The reasoning is
 * written out in `users.ts`.
 *
 * The English column names are not the ones this file was born with. A database written before
 * 2026-09-20 has `pessoas`/`sessoes`, and `#migrateFromPortuguese` below carries it over.
