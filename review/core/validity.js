/**
 * The traffic light of living documentation: what state each block's validation is in.
 *
 * The question this answers is not "did someone approve it?" but **"does the approval still
 * hold?"**. Those are different questions, and the second one is what matters in documentation
 * that keeps changing.
 *
 *   ⚪ none     nobody has validated it yet
 *   🟢 valid    validated, and nothing has changed since
 *   🟡 stale    this block's TEXT changed after the ✓ — nobody approved the new text
 *   🔴 broken   this block's text is unchanged, but something it DEPENDS ON changed
 *
 * The engine could always see yellow, through the fingerprint. Red is what makes documentation
 * living rather than merely traceable: it is what says *"this is still written exactly as
 * approved, but the rule it stood on moved — go check whether it is still true"*.
 *
 * ⚠️ Red is not an error. It is a **question**. The engine does not know the block became wrong —
 * it knows the block became SUSPECT, and that a human needs to look. Treating it as an error would
 * make people switch the check off at the first false positive, and then the whole lock is
 * pointless.
