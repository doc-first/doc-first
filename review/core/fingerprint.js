 * luck — one of them did not strip the review UI, so merely saving a marker into the HTML would
 * have turned every approval into "an earlier version of the text", silently, with nobody able to
 * say why.
 *
 * A rule like this is not kept identical in three places by discipline. It is kept by being one.
