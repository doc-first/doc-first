/**
 * Language choice. The core returns KEYS; the edge turns them into sentences.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the rule "nothing in Portuguese in the code" and the rule "the reviewer
 * reads in their own language" look like they contradict each other, and they do — as long as the
 * sentences live inside the code. Move them out and both hold at once.
 *
 * ⚠️ Three audiences, and they are not the same:
 *
 *   the reviewer      reads messages in the browser. Their language. Always translated.
 *   whoever operates  reads logs. English, always, and NOT through here — a log is evidence, and
 *                     evidence that changes wording by locale is evidence you cannot grep.
 *   whoever develops  reads configuration errors at boot. English, hard-coded: a service that
 *                     refuses to start has no session, no person and no chosen language yet.
 *
 * So this module serves the first audience only. Mixing the other two in was the mistake waiting
 * to happen.
