/**
 * Where a change lands: silent, on the agent's desk, or in front of a person.
 *
 * Git merges most branches without asking anybody. Not because it understands the code, but
 * because it has a cheap, sound test for "these two changes cannot touch each other". Documentation
 * has no such test — meaning is not lines — so instead of one test there is a funnel, and this
 * module is the deterministic stage of it: kind against kind, plus what the edit itself says.
 *
 * The measure of success is NOT how much impact it finds. It is how little of it reaches a person,
 * while nothing real gets through. Every flag that turns out to be noise is a step towards somebody
 * switching the whole check off, and then the lock is worth nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing here decides whether a block is still TRUE. It decides who has to look. The judgement
 * belongs to the agent (which has to show its reasoning) and to the person (who owns the ✓).
