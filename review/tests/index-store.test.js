/**
 * The index stores where each dependency lands, not just that it exists.
 *
 * `severityOf` was written, tested cell by cell, and called by nobody — a function, not a pipeline.
 * These tests are the wiring: they prove the matrix reaches the database, that the loud pairs can
 * be asked for by name, and that a database written before the column existed does not poison the
 * next run.
 *
 * ⚠️ The severity written at index time is the MATRIX ALONE. There is no earlier text on disk, so
 * `signalsOf` has nothing to compare and the three signals of stage 3b are absent by design. The
 * test named "the stored severity is the matrix alone" exists so that nobody later reads a silent
 * pair as "the engine looked at the edit and shrugged".
