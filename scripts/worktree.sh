# means no `node_modules`, so the first thing you do in the new tree is wait three minutes for an
# install of dependencies that are already on the disk, one directory over. Multiply that by the
# four parallel branches you opened precisely to save time.
#
# It also exists so that two agents working at once cannot step on each other: each gets its own
# tree and its own branch, and the only shared thing is a read-only symlink.
