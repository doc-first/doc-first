# Prior art

> Research, `2026-09-22`. What already exists, so the contribution is not overstated.

Doc First's core primitive is not new. "A link becomes suspect when either end changes, and stays
suspect until a person clears it" is the suspect-link pattern from requirements traceability —
over twenty years old in IBM DOORS, Jama Connect, Helix ALM and Visure Solutions, theorised by
Bohner and Arnold in *Software Change Impact Analysis* (1996). Swimm does the equivalent for code
references inside docs. Ketryx sells "AI keeps the trace, a human confirms" for medical device
software. Comala does page-level approval states inside Confluence. Kiro gates an agent on a human
sign-off per spec document. None of that is being reinvented by accident — it is the field Doc
First belongs to. **Doc First is requirements traceability rebuilt for prose, in the open, for the
age of coding agents.**

## The theory, as three claims

- **Approval is a claim about a text, so it is content-addressed.** Not about a block, a version
  number or a date — about the exact bytes a person read. The lock is a SHA-256 of the normalized
  text, not a flag.
- **Impact is a property of the pair of kinds, not of the change**, so it is a table. What matters
  is not "this changed" but "a change of *this* kind touched a dependent of *that* kind" — gravity
  crossed with sensitivity, a small table instead of one suspect bit.
- **An agent can verify a relation between two texts, but not a truth about the world**, so it
  closes and never approves. "This still holds" is checkable from the repository; "this is
  correct" is a claim about reality nothing in a repository can check.

## What no surveyed tool has

1. **Approval bound to a SHA-256 of the normalized text** — a fact about bytes, not a date, a
   version pointer or an attribute flag. Every surveyed tool keys off a timestamp or version ID.
2. **A computed four-state light**, separating "this text changed" (🟡) from "the ground moved"
   (🔴). Every surveyed tool has one flag, and cannot say which happened.
3. **Severity as a small gravity×sensitivity table**, plus deliberate one-hop anti-transitivity —
   against the industry's single flag, which propagates transitively into "suspect storms" that
   make teams switch the check off.
4. **The agent barred from approving, constitutionally** — it may close, never approve. The
   2025-26 spec-driven wave (Spec Kit, Kiro, OpenSpec, Tessl, BMAD) has nothing like this.
5. **A bug as a contradiction between two documents**, with a third outcome — the hole — for
   behaviour nobody wrote down. Every tracker loses this case as "works as intended."
6. **Git as the only writer of content**; the site only records append-only events, trigger-enforced.

## What Doc First should borrow

1. **Diff-aware suspicion**, from Jama's version diff — the git-diff layer `docs/IMPACT.md` admits
   is the unbuilt half of the edit-level signals.
2. **A reason field on every approval and closure**, from 21 CFR Part 11 — the event log has
   author, timestamp and fingerprint, never *why*.
3. **Baselines as frozen snapshots by git tag**, from Polarion — "what did this look like at the
   last release," independent of any one block's own approval.
4. **Typed relations for "respect"**, with a light syntax like `dependsOn::value` — from Semantic
   MediaWiki's `Property::`, Polarion's `verifies`/`derives`, and C4's labelled relationships.
5. **Subject-by-name links, with a backlink index and aliases for renames** — from Obsidian,
   Dendron and Foam. Luhmann's Folgezettel precedes a positional id (`data-cod`) kept distinct
   from a link.
6. **Auto-repair of provably trivial moves**, from Swimm — a rename should not cost the same red
   mark as a real change.
7. **`data-prova` verifying the test runs and passes**, not that the file exists — from doctest,
   Doc Detective and Concordion, which execute the claim rather than check a path.
8. **The reverse hole** — behaviour with no document — from DO-178C's extraneous-code finding.
   Today the engine only catches the opposite: a document with no behaviour.
9. **A closure-chain report**, from GAMP 5's validated state — answers "prove nothing downstream
   of this red block quietly stayed green," without giving up one-hop propagation.
10. **A reverse-index page before any force graph**, from Backstage — a static list of what
    depends on what; a dense graph becomes unreadable at scale.

## Not borrowed, and why

- **Competency gates on approvers** (Qualio) — the owner/admin split is about power, not
  qualification; a training check needs a training system Doc First has no reason to own.
- **CAPA loops** (Greenlight Guru, GAMP 5) — root-cause and effectiveness records belong to a
  quality-management system; a bug here ends at triage, not a corrective-action.

## Positioning

Not "nobody does documentation-centred systems" — plenty do, some older than this repository's
authors. The honest claim is narrower: traceability with suspect links, for prose, content-
addressed, with an agent that may close but never approve. The nearest neighbours are Ketryx,
which runs close to the same computation for regulated software but is closed-source and built
around named regulatory artifacts (URS, FS, DS) Doc First lacks; and Swimm, which computes the
same shape of staleness but only for a doc's pointer into code, never one document's prose against
another's. Doc First sits between them: open, prose-first, stricter about what an agent may decide.
